                <br>
                <p>Hi, My name is Dennis Gaona and I am switching careers from Mechanical Engineering to Web Development / Software Engineering. I have held multiple professional
                     jobs as a mechanical engineer, ranging from Draftsman to Design Engineer. After about 2 years in the professional workforce, I was given the opportunity to work on 
                     some mechanical related coding, attempting to automate some of my design processes to make work a lot easier. I fell in love immediately and dedicated all of my free
                      time henceforth towards learning how to code. I am currently starting in Web Development to become a full stack developer and will figure out where to flourish 
                      from there. Thanks for reading this! Enjoy the rest of my website!
